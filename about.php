                        <p>Alunan Asas started out as a renovation house in Sungai Puyu, with the factory renovation for MNC in Prai as its first project. With over 25 years of experience, this construction company's expertise covers geo-technical, infrastructure and buildings of various types and heights. It has completed a host of renovation, building and construction projects by prioritising skilful and quality workmanship and timely delivery with cost savings.</p>

<p>A winning combination of customers' trust, teamwork and dedication has led to Alunan Asas' expansion to Kuala Lumpur. Its core construction and property development business have successfully expanded to Kuala Lumpur and Klang Valley to cater to its growing clientele. It is currently operating with support from the headquarters situated in Batu Kawan. There are over 300 well-trained and highly efficient staff members upholding the company's core values and culture as well as forging strong relationships with all stakeholders.</p>

<p>Through the usage of Virtual Design Construction (VDC) and Building Information Modeling (BIM), Alunan Asas strives for excellence in terms of designs, material and methods for every project. It supports CIDB’s Industrialised Building System (IBS) and implements procedures to reduce labour dependency and carbon footprint in all activities. This ensures cost savings and speedier construction as well as the mitigation of any potential errors and obstacles during construction through VDC.</p>

<p>Today, we have a complete VDC team that provides better visualisation of projects in 3D. This helps minimise clashes through swift and accurate identification of different building parts such as columns and doors (proper planning in design stage before construction stage). With comprehensive visualisation and fewer interference problems, the team achieves higher productivity and enhanced performance. In line with our VDC team keeping up-to-date with the most advanced construction technology, we continuously look out for new technologies to implement and maximise them to our advantage.</p>

<p>With support from our existing and new customers, our customer base has grown substantially hence marking our exponential growth from a 100mil revenue company to a billion revenue corporate company today. Our customers consist of established companies such as Island & Peninsular (I&P) and Sime Darby, who have remained our loyal customers today even though I&P had since merged with Setia Group.</p>

<p>To date, Alunan Asas’ total contract value done so far is worth RM1.783bil with an annual turnover of RM552mil including prominent projects from established companies such as TPPT, Sime Darby, Setia, Sunway, Granflo, Sunsuria, Topglove and more.</p>

<p>With quality at the heart of every project, Alunan Asas has won numerous QLASSIC awards, namely QLASSIC Awards of Excellence 2016, QLASSIC Awards of Excellence 2017 and CIDC SHASSIC, just to mention a few.</p>

                    <p>When we founded the company in 1993 as Alunan Asas, it was the proverbial humble beginning for all of us. Together we casted our vision and resolutely committed to work as a team towards achieving our values and goals. The company in the early days undertook mostly minor projects ranging from building labs in USM to building factories in the free trade zone. We put our heart and soul into everything that we put our hands to and the results were testament to our high quality standards and strategic insights. Soon we were acknowledged in the property industry, our reputation grew and we were entrusted with larger projects such as the bus terminal at Sungai Nibong, Sekolah Menengah Sains in Kepala Batas, UiTM in Permatang Pauh and many more noteworthy projects.</p>

<p>Metrio Group then progressed and diversified to become a manufacturer of aluminium formwork under MyForm and a prominent housing developer under Metrio Development. We continued to excel in our respective fields and today, we have delivered more than 1,000 residential and commercial units. Our solid track record encompasses projects in Penang island and mainland, with expansion into Klang Valley by this year. Driven by our passion for building and dedication to quality, we plan to further expand our portfolio to more states in Malaysia and the Asia Pacific region.  </p>

<p>We aspire to offer a host of services, namely property construction using the latest technology as well as innovative housing development and manufacturing of related construction methods and materials. These services are aimed to bring greater value to end users at a competitive cost, be it individual buyers, housing developers, contractors and other corporate companies. These 3 main component arms provide the synergy and expertise integral in setting new benchmarks in the property industry and have driven us to remarkable milestones.</p>

<p>The year 2018 marked an important milestone in our history, as we officially made a move to our new corporate office, MetrioPlex at Vortex Business Park in Batu Kawan. From our headquarters in MetrioPlex, we will continue to provide top-notch services to our customers and business associates. Our newly-unveiled brand identity is another bold and significant step in our forward-thinking progress. It is representative of our stellar growth throughout these years and also signifies our renewed commitment to excellence in building landmark projects. </p>

<p>Since our inception, we have firmly adhered to our core values of professionalism, dynamism, synergism and optimism to deliver quality projects and services. This is expressed in our corporate tagline 'Building Timeless Quality', which projects the excellence and innovation that is embedded in every aspect of our day-to-day operations. With a customer-focused approach, along with highly skilled and talented teams, we at Metrio Group are dedicated to continuously meeting the ever-changing market needs and enhancing lifestyles. Our prudent management and customer-friendly approach won the trust of our loyal customers who are still with us today.</p>
